# Plotting GOES Fire Detections using Google Earth Engine and Python

Earlier today, the Google Earth Engine team [posted a tutorial](https://medium.com/google-earth/how-to-generate-wildfire-boundary-maps-with-earth-engine-b38eadc97a38) to show how their platform can be used to process and visualize fire detections obtained by the GOES-16 and GOES-17 satellites.

This repository contains a rough Jupyter notebook which expands on their tutorial by demonstrating how this can be done from Python.

Disclaimer: I am not an expert in analyzing Earth Observation data or using the Earth Engine platform.  Proceed with caution.  All feedback welcome.
